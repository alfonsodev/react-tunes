## About the stack.
React tunes uses `hapi` framework integrated with `swagger`.
`Docker` is used to release to heroku.
`CircleCI` is used for automated builds, but currently just running webpack and eslint steps.

## Future improvements
- `monorepo`: When adding the UI, we could have multiple packages (api, ui), in this same repo using `lerna`, or `yarn` workspaces.
- `automation`: We could configure an automatic release when code is merged in master, by using either herouku pipelines, gitlab runners or other CI/CD tools.
- `git hooks`: We could add [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to make sure we pass `eslint` and run unit tests before pushing.
- `unit-tests`: Add jest, and some unit/functional test, explore testing posibilities with swagger.  
- `documentation`: Include some documentation about how to setup the local development environment with/without Docker, and how to use nodemon to reload on save.
