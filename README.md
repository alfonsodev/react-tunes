# ⚛️🎶 React Tunes
Demo application for a itunes-like application written in React and Nodejs.
## getting started

## Future improvements
- `monorepo`: When adding the UI, we could have multiple packages (api, ui), in this same repo using `lerna`, or `yarn` workspaces.
- `automation`: We could configure an automatic release when code is merged in master, by using either herouku pipelines, gitlab runners or other CI/CD tools.
- `git hooks`: We could add [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to make sure we pass `eslint` and run unit tests before pushing.
- `unit-tests`: Add jest, and some unit/functional test, explore testing posibilities with swagger.  
- `documentation`: Include some documentation about how to setup the local development environment with/without Docker.
